# Hangman_Game_Project

This is a fun, collaborative and simple team project worked on and completed over the course of an entire semester. It was built using IntelliJ IDE and the GUI used to run it is JavaFX.

# Installing

I used IntelliJ IDE in order to make this entire program as well as the GUI using JavaFX, so my advice on how to download and run this program would be to first download IntelliJ. Once that's set up, you'll want to create a new project, create the src folder for this project, create a package named 'sample' within that src folder and then create two classes in that package. Name one 'HangmanGame.java' and the other 'Controller.java', and then copy paste the corresponding code from the files here on Github into them.

If you need better direction on how to create an IntelliJ project, feel free to use the detailed guides posted by JetBrains (who created IntelliJ) on how to do so.

# Executing Program

Once you've copy pasted all of the right code into the right files, you'll be able to click run at the top, IntelliJ will execute the project and the GUI built by JavaFX should pop up. Then, you can go ahead and dive in to playing Hangman! Guess all the right letters for the secret word before you lose all your tries and you win the game!

# How to Contribute/How to Expand

Now, this game of Hangman is limited in some ways; there's a pool of about ten pre-determined words in the word bank that can be used at all times, and you can't just write out the entire word even if you have the right answer in order to win. Thus, you have to entire letter by letter, even if you know the answer, and you also have a limited selection of words to play from with the way the code is written. 

In order to expand on this project, I'll have to look into stretching the logic to allow for an option to enter the word manually, as well as manually adding more words to the word bank or by installing a random word generator that picks from a bunch of words at complete random. Those are ways I can expand on the project, as well as anyone else who'd like to contribute, if there are improvements to make, as we didn't make these additions back then mainly because we ran out of time to seriously expand this project.
